#Github for Poets

**Jargon alert:**

 - *commit*
 - *branch*
 - *repo*
 - *fork*
 - *pull request*
 - *push*
 - *markdown*

**Github** is a web-based hosting service for softwaree development projects that use the Git revision control system.

- Allows you to "push" and "pull" local repositiories to and from remote repositories.
- Homepage that displays your public repos
- Repos are backed up on GitHub server in case something happens to local copies
- Social, learn from others code. 

## Install Git
### Git == **Version Control**
- free and open source
- created by the same people who developed Linux
- Repositories are key
- operated from the command line.

Download & Install Git: [http://git-scm.com/downloads](http://git-scm.com/downloads)

(go with default options unless you know what you're doing)

### Configure Username and Email
	
	git config --global user.name "Your Name Here"
	git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"
	git config --list
	
You only have to do this once, but you can change these down the road with the same commands

## Setup a GitHub Account
1. [https://github.com](https://github.com)
2. Enter username, email, and pw and click "Sign up for Github"
3. Use same email address you used when setting up Git.
4. Free Plan

## Recap: Git vs. Github

- You don't need Github to use Git
- Git = Local (on your computer); Github = Remote (on the web)

## Creating a GitHub Repo

Two methods:

1. Start a repositroy from scratch
2. "Fork" another user's repo
